   curl -o jira.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/jira-bash/main/jira.sh
   chmod +x jira.sh
   ```

2. Move to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # System-wide installation (requires sudo):
   sudo mv jira.sh /usr/local/bin/jira
   
   # Or user-specific installation:
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin  # Create directory if it doesn't exist
   mv jira.sh ~/.local/bin/jira
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/jira
   
   # Make sure the directory is in your PATH:
   # Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if needed:
   # export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
   ```

3. Initialize your project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   jira init
   ```

Alternatively, use the installer script:

# Change a ticket's status
jira transition PROJECT-123 "Done"

# Assign a ticket
jira assign PROJECT-123 --assignee "user@example.com"

### Sprint Management

jira sprint view 42

# Create a new sprint
jira sprint create "Sprint 7" --start-date 2025-06-01 --end-date 2025-06-15 --goal "Implement OAuth"

jira epic list

# View epic details and child issues
jira epic view PROJECT-100

# Create a new epic
jira epic create "User Authentication Overhaul"

# Add a ticket to an epic
jira epic add PROJECT-123 PROJECT-100
```

### Global Options

```
--dry-run          Show what would happen without making changes
--verbose or -v    Show detailed debugging information
--format <fmt>     Output format: default, json, or csv
```

## Configuration

Jira-Bash uses per-project configuration, which allows each project to connect to its own specific Jira instance.

### Project Configuration

Each project has its own configuration file in the project's root directory:

- `.jira-config.ini`: Contains project-specific settings including:
  - Jira URL for this project
  - Project key
  - Default options like issue type and priority

### Credentials

Credentials are stored centrally to avoid duplicating sensitive information:

- `~/.config/jira-cli/credentials`: Securely stores your Jira username and API token

### Setting Up a New Project

To initialize a new project with jira-bash:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
jira init
```

This creates a `.jira-config.ini` file in your project directory that you'll need to edit to set your specific Jira URL.
