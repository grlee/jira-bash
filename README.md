## Configuration

The script stores configuration in `~/.config/jira-cli/`:

- `config.sh`: Contains your Jira URL, default project, and other preferences
- `credentials`: Securely stores your Jira username and API token

You can edit these files directly or run `jira config` for guided setup.

- **go-jira**: More developer-focused with extensive filtering capabilities
- **jira-cli**: Official Atlassian tool with cloud and server support
- **jirash**: More customizable but requires more setup
