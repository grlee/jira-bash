2. Implement an interactive mode for complex operations
3. Add Bash/Zsh completion scripts

### Testing
1. Create more comprehensive tests
2. Add mocking capability for Jira API responses
3. Test on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows with Git Bash)

### Distribution and Packaging
1. Create packages for common package managers (apt, homebrew, etc.)
2. Add Docker container for portable usage
3. Implement a version check and update notification

### Additional Features
1. Add worklog management
2. Implement filter creation and management
3. Add dashboard viewing
4. Support for custom fields and workflows
5. Add offline mode for basic operations

## Comparison with Alternatives

Jira-Bash sits in a unique position among Jira CLI tools:

1. **Simplicity**: Unlike more complex tools like go-jira or the official Atlassian CLI, Jira-Bash is a single script with minimal dependencies.

2. **Sprint and Epic Focus**: Where many tools treat these as secondary features, Jira-Bash places strong emphasis on sprint and epic management.

3. **Ease of Installation**: No compilation required, just download and run.

4. **Low Learning Curve**: Commands follow an intuitive pattern that aligns with how users think about Jira operations.

## License Recommendation

The MIT License is an appropriate choice for this project because:

1. It's permissive and allows for commercial use
2. It's compatible with most other open-source licenses
3. It's widely understood and accepted in the open-source community
4. It provides basic liability protection while allowing maximum freedom for users

## Next Steps

The most immediate priorities should be:

1. Complete the API implementation for all placeholder functions
2. Test thoroughly on different platforms
3. Create a GitHub repository with issue templates and CI/CD setup
4. Publish the first official release with appropriate version numbering
